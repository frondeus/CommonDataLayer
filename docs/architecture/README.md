[API] - used as a backend service for frontend, provides unified interface to manage CDL.

## Configuration Layer

## Ingestion Layer
Crate Name              | Purpose
------------------------|--------
[data-router]             | Route incoming data from and through MQ for consumption by the specific Command Service

## Storage Layer

Crate Name              | Purpose
------------------------|--------
[query-service]           | Wrap each individual repository for retrieval of data
[command-service]         | Intake data from a MQ and storage, in specific repository
[db-shrinker-storage]     | A service to remove older data from storage

## Retrieval Layer
Crate Name              | Purpose

rpc                     | A collection of GRPC proto files and automatically generated client/server code.
utils                   | A collection of utilities used throughout the Common Data Layer

## Useful directories

Directory       | Purpose
----------------|--------
deploy/helm     | helm charts for remote deployment
deploy/compose  | sample deployment guide for docker
benchmarking    | scripts and scaffolding data for benchmarking
tests           | component tests
examples        | examplary client of cdl
docs            | cdl documentation
